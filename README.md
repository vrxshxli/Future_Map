Installation
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js (v18.x or higher) and npm (v9.x or higher) for the frontend.
PHP (v8.1 or higher) for the backend.
MySQL (v8.0 or higher) for the database.
Composer (PHP dependency manager).
Git for cloning the repository.
A web server like Apache or Nginx (e.g., via XAMPP, MAMP, or a local PHP server).
A code editor like VS Code.

Backend Setup

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/futuremap.git
cd futuremap


Navigate to the Backend Directory:
cd backend


Install PHP Dependencies:
composer install


Configure Environment:

Copy the example environment file:cp .env.example .env


Edit .env to configure database credentials and other settings:DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=futuremap
DB_USERNAME=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
APP_URL=http://localhost




Set Up Apache/Nginx:

Place the backend folder in your web server's root directory (e.g., htdocs for XAMPP).
Ensure the server is configured to point to the backend folder.
For Apache, enable mod_rewrite and configure .htaccess if needed.



Database Setup

Create a MySQL Database:
CREATE DATABASE futuremap;


Import the Database Schema:

Locate the database.sql file in the backend directory (create one if not provided, based on your schema).
Import it into MySQL:mysql -u your_username -p futuremap < backend/database.sql




Verify Database Connection:

Ensure the .env credentials match your MySQL setup.
Test the connection by running a PHP script or checking API endpoints.



Frontend Setup

Navigate to the Frontend Directory:
cd ../frontend


Install Node.js Dependencies:
npm install


Configure Environment:

Create a .env file in the frontend directory:cp .env.example .env


Update .env with the backend API URL:VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost/Futuremap-backend




Build the Frontend:
npm run build



Running the Application

Start the Backend Server:

If using XAMPP, start Apache and MySQL.
Alternatively, use PHP's built-in server:cd backend
php -S localhost:8000




Start the Frontend Development Server:
cd frontend
npm run dev


Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173 (or the port shown in the terminal).


Access the Application:

Sign in as a student, mentor, or institute.
Use the Career Path Builder to create paths, connect with mentors, or manage schedules.
